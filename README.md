\# Urban Green Space \& Neighborhood Change



This project explores how access to parks and green spaces affects neighborhood economic mobility, residential stability, and community behavior using data from \[Trust for Public Land’s ParkServe](https://www.tpl.org/parkserve) and public datasets (Census, Opportunity Atlas, etc.).



\## Research Question

Do urban green investments benefit existing residents, or accelerate displacement?

We combine spatial data, demographic trends, and behavioral metrics to estimate causal effects of park access.
